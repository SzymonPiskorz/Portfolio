# Portfolio
Some of the work I did by myself or as part of a team over the last few years.
Out of the projects in this repo:

Solo Projects:
I did Pacman by myself and contributed all the code for the game to work.
SFML_Playground-master has a tank game I made for a project last year.

Group Projects:
Geometry Wars like game was a group project between 4 people. I did the player and projectile scripts. As well as level 2 and 3 and the game controller script used in each level and a gravity body and gravity pull scripts.

Hotline Miami Clone was a group project between 2 people. I did the enemy movement and behaviour, the majority of the game controller for level completion, Level 2, Menu and Pause scenes, added in the code for sending the data. As well as the car animation in the game.
